# **Iron-Meals**

[App Link](https://iron-meals.herokuapp.com/)

### **Description**

A helpful eating strategy application using MongoDB, React and Materialize to name a few. If your weeks start out with good intentions and good, healthy meals but quickly devolve into fast food, convenience store food or greasy takeout food, then you could likely benefit from Iron-Meals. The application involves planning your meals with a convenient grocery shopping list generated by your recipe's added to your week. Once you generate a user profile with your personal information and what it is that you expect out of that week in regards to protein, fat and carb intakes then in no time will you be back on track. With consumers and families who are busier than ever, meal prepping simply makes it easier to eat well throughout the week.
